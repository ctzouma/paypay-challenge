# PayPay Coding Challenge
* The backend for the application will be developed with Node.js, Express.js and SQLite


* The frontend will be developed with AngularJS (version < 2). 
This is due to the fact that my only experience is with this version of Angular.\
I will be using the component style design introduced in the latest versions of AngularJS.


* The project will also leverage TypeScript


# Running the project
TBA


# High level design
* You will need to login to the page with your user details.


* A user is an employee, and an admin is a user with a flag to check for increased privellages.


* A regular user will not be able to access the admin page.


* Admins may add new employees (i.e users), therefore they will be setting the username / password of that employee.

# Assumptions
* Assuming each employee has only one performance review of their own each
